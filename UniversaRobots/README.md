A few examples tested on the UR10 at EidVGS

Update 07.10.2018
Ubuntu 18.10
Python 3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip


The examples have been tested on a Windows 10 box with Anaconda Python installed

The urx library (Need to recheck this) was automatically installed when it was included in the Spyder editor.

Other examples use the UR10 API directly.
